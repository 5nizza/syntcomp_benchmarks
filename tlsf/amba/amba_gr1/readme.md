These benchmarks are the closest version to [1] we have in the repo.
They are generated by the script `spec_generator/amba_spec_generator.py`,
which itself is a python translation of the original perl script used in [1].
Note that the resulting specs slightly differ from the LTL versions described in [2]
(I don't know what is the difference).

There are two versions:

- GR1 versions: these are the originals
  The files were generated using the command `./amba_spec_generator.py -tlsf <num_masters>`

- GR1+ versions: these versions extend the originals by adding a few LTL parts
  The files were generated using the command `./amba_spec_generator.py -tlsf -gfgf -fg-ind <num_masters>`.
  See more details about these specs in `./spec_generator/readme.md`.
  (Note: there is a possibility to use `-fg` as well, but the specs generated are too hard even for `n=2`.)

The specs are in folder `specs`.
