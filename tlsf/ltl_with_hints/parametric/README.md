These examples are inspired by the paper
LTL Reactive Synthesis with a Few Hints
by Mrudula Balachander, Emmanuel Filiot, and Jean-Francois Raskin

Their problem is:
-> LTL spec + example traces
<- machine that satisfies the LTL spec and exhibits the traces

Here, the traces are encoded directly into LTL.
