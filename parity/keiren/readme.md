The benchmarks in this folder were generated using the
pg2hoa.py script from hoa-tools, a modified version of
the script can be found here

The original benchmarks come from Keiren's [benchmark
repo](https://github.com/jkeiren/paritygame-generator). Only files that were
at most 50MB in size were translated (and only the resulting games of at most
that size were kept).
