The benchmarks in this folder were submitted by [Tim Willemse](https://lmcs.episciences.org/6812) in the PGSolver
format and then translated to extended HOA using the pg2hoa.py script from
hoa-tools.

These games are derived from the four properties that can be found in [this paper](https://lmcs.episciences.org/6812).
