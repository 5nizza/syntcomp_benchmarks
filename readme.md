## SYNTCOMP benchmarks

This repository contains all benchmarks collected over the years by [SYNTCOMP](http://www.syntcomp.org/) community.
There are three kinds of benchmarks describing three different formats:

- `aiger`: safety games encoded in the [extended AIGER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.5793.pdf) format,
- `tlsf`: LTL synthesis encoded in [TLSF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02284.pdf) format,
- `parity`: parity games encoded in the [extended HOA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05793.pdf) format.

Their folders contain more descriptions.

## Submitting new benchmarks

To submit a new benchmark

- create a new issue
- attach an archive with your new benchmarks with a sensible name
- the archive should also contain `readme.md` or `readme.pdf`
  describing the benchmarks, relevant papers, etc.

We will check if everything is ok, and then add to the repository.
Alternatively, you can create a pull request with your benchmarks.

## Downloading benchmarks

[Releases](https://github.com/5nizza/syntcomp_benchmarks/releases) contain the benchmarks used in specific years.
